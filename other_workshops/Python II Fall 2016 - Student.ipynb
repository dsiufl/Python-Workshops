    "Now that we've learned how to acquire, clean, and visualize our data, let's start doing some machine learning. Throughout this workshop, we will be using a Python package called scikit-learn. It is surprisingly easy to implement machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn, and in fact much of the work is done for you. Often, it is the acquisition and structuring of the data itself that requires the most finesse. Because of this, we will be working with pre-processed data to illustrate just how simple machine learning can be using scikit-learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive in, let's start with some background on machine learning. There are two main types of machine learning algorithms: **supervised** and **unsupervised**. The goal of **supervised learning** is to train a model to classify data against a set of labels. For instance, we can train a model to separate images according to whether or not the image contains a face. In this case, the two labels would be *face* and *no face*. The presence of labeled training data is a huge advantage in machine learning, however it is not always available.\n",
    "\n",
    "When labeled training data is unavailable, we must use **unsupervised learning**. The goal of unsupervised learning is to train a model to extract *meaningful features* from the data. These meaningful features are often common patterns which are useful for compressing the information contained in the data. For example, in speech recognition, individual phonemes serve as meaningful features from which it is possible to reconstruct words independently of their tone or pitch. In computer vision, oriented edge-detectors are often the best features."
