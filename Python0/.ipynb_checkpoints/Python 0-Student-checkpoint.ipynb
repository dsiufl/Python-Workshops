    "### What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an easy-to-use and robust **Object-Oriented** programming language. A lot of new software application are built with Python for this reason. It is used in other areas of computer science such and software engineering, digital arts, cybersecurity, and of course Data Science! \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a workshop that will introduce you to the basics of python and introduce you to Data Science and Visualization in Python. Due to the breadth of the language there are still many topics left for you to explore! Here we teach you the necessary skills. "
