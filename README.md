# Python-Workshops
Materials for Python workshops at UF DSI

This is the repo that contains jupyter notebooks for workshops hosted by DSI at UF.

All of the code is written in **Python 3** and uses common scientific libraries. 

## Installing Scientific Python environment
We highly recommend to use Anaconda. It is a package manager that greatly simplifies the process to get Python running on your machine. Package managers gather and update software with their dependencies. They are hard to live without.

The default packages installed contains all of the libraries need to run all of the workshops. Windows, Linux, and Mac is supported.

For Windows, this is especially important since it doesn't have a default package manager like most distributions of Linux has.

Choose the appropriate version for your OS and make sure it's **Python 3**.

## Running
Jupyter notebook works by hosting a webpage on your computer where you access it locally. Think of it like a website that can access and save local files. This means any OS with a web browser can use jupyter.

Most of the time you start a session via command line. This will open a jupyter webpage on your browser.
```
$ jupyter notebook "UF DSI Python 0 - 10_26_16 - Student.ipynb"
```

For windows, `cmd` works. For Linux, pick your favorite emulator.

Note: there is a desktop app called "Jupyter Notebook" that also starts a session. If you don't feel comfortable with a command line, this is a good option.

## Python 0 workshop
Download this repo as a zip file and extract it.

The file we will be using is `UF DSI Python 0 - 10_26_16 - Student.ipynb`. It should be located in the first level of this folder.

`UF DSI Python 0 - 10_26_16 - Instructor.ipynb` contains all of the sections filled out with code. 

## Other workshops
`other_workshop` contains notebooks of other workshops that DSI hosts such as Python I/II and machine learning. They contain examples of notebooks that go beyond the basics.
